# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning is lockstep across all five crates in this workspace (one
`[workspace.package].version`, bumped together regardless of which crate(s)
changed) rather than independent per-crate versioning —
see the root README's "Consuming these crates" section for what that means
for a consumer's pin.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- `proxy::body`: `Buffered::TimedOut`, `buffer_or_stream_within` and
  `buffer_request_or_stream` — the body-buffering deadline variants and the
  biased-timer `buffer_bounded` core, ported from limen and generic over
  axum `Body` streams.
- `proxy::forwarded::apply_forwarded` — an `X-Forwarded-*` policy engine
  (`ForwardedPolicy`, `XffPolicy`, `XfpPolicy`) that makes a proxy's XFF/XFP
  trust decision explicit per leg, with no `Default` impl.
- `methods` module — `CLASSIFIED_METHODS`, `method_filter`,
  `refusing_unserved_over` — truthful HTTP method refusal helpers built
  around a caller-chosen method universe, with no-op (not panic) behavior on
  an empty refused set.
- `proxy::UpstreamFailure` — a pure `reqwest::Error` classifier plus a
  `tracing` logging helper, and `AppError::bad_gateway_upstream` /
  `AppError::bad_gateway_upstream_with_context` — a redacted `502`
  constructor for consumers on this crate's `AppError` envelope.
- `deny.toml` (license allow-list) plus a `cargo-deny check licenses` step
  in CI's `build-test` job, and a separate non-required `audit` job running
  `cargo-audit`.
- `cargo-semver-checks` in CI, run per-crate against the latest reachable
  `v*` tag (advisory/non-blocking until `v0.4.0` itself is tagged and
  becomes the new baseline).
- This CHANGELOG.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `proxy::body::Buffered` is now `#[non_exhaustive]` (to make
  room for the `TimedOut` variant above without every future variant being a
  major-version break). A `match` on `Buffered` outside this crate that does
  not include a wildcard arm (`_ => ...`) now fails to compile.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-04

`stridelabs-http`'s `openapi` feature sharpened from first-consumer
feedback: the public API surface tightened and `OperationNotFound`'s
contract corrected to match what it actually returns.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

`stridelabs-http` gained an optional `openapi` feature (canonicalizing
serializer, exhaustive `(method, path)` enumeration, committed-spec
freshness check), and the pinned Rust toolchain moved to 1.97.1.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-25

Initial release: `stridelabs-config`, `stridelabs-observability`,
`stridelabs-http`, `stridelabs-auth` and `stridelabs-testing`, seeded from
spendwise-rs and limen.
